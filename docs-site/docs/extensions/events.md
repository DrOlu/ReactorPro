# Events Reference

Extensions can listen to and modify events throughout AiderDesk. This page documents all available events and their properties.

## Modifying Event Properties

Properties in event interfaces can be modified by returning a partial event from your handler. The rule is simple:

- Properties marked `readonly` **cannot** be modified
- Properties without `readonly` **can** be modified by returning them in a partial event

```typescript
// Example: Modifying a modifiable property
async onAgentStarted(event: AgentStartedEvent, context: ExtensionContext) {
  // prompt is NOT readonly, so it can be modified
  return {
    prompt: event.prompt?.toUpperCase(),
  };
}
```

## Event Handling Patterns

### 1. Read-Only
Observe the event without modifying anything.

```typescript
async onTaskClosed(event: TaskClosedEvent, context: ExtensionContext) {
  context.log(`Task ${event.task.name} closed`, 'info');
  // Return nothing - event continues unchanged
}
```

### 2. Blocking
Prevent an operation by setting `blocked: true`.

```typescript
async onToolCalled(event: ToolCalledEvent, context: ExtensionContext) {
  if (event.toolName === 'dangerous_tool') {
    return { blocked: true };  // Prevents execution
  }
}
```

### 3. Modifying
Change event data by returning a partial event.

```typescript
async onAgentStarted(event: AgentStartedEvent, context: ExtensionContext) {
  return {
    agentProfile: {
      ...event.agentProfile,
      customInstructions: event.agentProfile.customInstructions + '\nBe concise.',
    },
  };
}
```

# Extensions

Extensions allow you to extend and customize AiderDesk's functionality. They can add new tools, commands, modes, agent profiles, and react to various events in the application lifecycle.

## What Extensions Can Do

### Register New Capabilities

- **Tools** - Add custom tools that the AI can use (e.g., run linters, execute scripts, query databases)
- **Commands** - Create slash commands like `/generate-tests` or `/deploy`
- **Modes** - Define custom chat modes with specific behaviors
- **Agent Profiles** - Create specialized agents with custom instructions and settings


### Hook into Events

Extensions can listen to and modify events throughout AiderDesk:

- **Task Events** - Task creation, initialization, updates, and closure
- **Agent Events** - Agent execution start, finish, and step completion
- **Tool Events** - Tool approval, execution, and completion
- **File Events** - Files added to or dropped from context
- **Prompt Events** - Prompt submission and processing
- **Response Events** - Response chunks and completion
- **And more...**

### Modify Behavior

Many events allow extensions to modify data before it's processed:

- Block dangerous operations (e.g., prevent `rm -rf` commands)
- Transform prompts before sending to the AI
- Filter files being added to context
- Auto-answer approval requests
- Modify AI responses

## Extension Locations

Extensions can be installed at two levels:

| Level | Path | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Global** | `~/.aider-desk/extensions/` | Available to all projects |
| **Project** | `./.aider-desk/extensions/` | Only for the current project |

Project-level extensions can override global extensions with the same name.

## Hot Reload

Extensions are **automatically reloaded** when changes are detected. There's no need to restart AiderDesk when developing or modifying extensions. Just save your file and the changes take effect within seconds.

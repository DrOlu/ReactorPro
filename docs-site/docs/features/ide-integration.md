# IDE Integration

ReactorPro is designed to work seamlessly with your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Through dedicated plugins and extensions, you can automatically sync the files you are working on with ReactorPro's context, creating a fluid and efficient workflow.

## Supported IDEs

### Visual Studio Code

- **Extension**: [ReactorPro Connector on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hyperspace-sk.reactorpro-connector)
- **Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hyperspace/reactorpro-connector-vscode-extension)

The VSCode extension automatically adds the currently active file in your editor to the ReactorPro context. When you switch to a different file, it replaces the previous one, ensuring the AI's focus is always on your current task.

### IntelliJ IDEA (and other JetBrains IDEs)

- **Plugin**: [ReactorPro Connector on JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26313-aiderdesk-connector)
- **Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hyperspace/reactorpro-connector-intellij-plugin)

The IntelliJ plugin provides similar functionality, syncing the active editor file with ReactorPro's context. It is compatible with a wide range of JetBrains IDEs, including WebStorm, PyCharm, and GoLand.
